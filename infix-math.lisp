  "Basic C-style operator precedence, with some differences.

   The use of MIN, MAX, GCD and LCM as infix operators is after
   Dijkstra (see EWD 1300). Perl 6 is also supposed to use them this
   way, and I have adopted its precedence levels.

   Bitwise operators have a higher precedence than predicates. See
   <http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/dmr/chist.html>, where Dennis
   Ritchie considers C's ordering infelicitous.

   All predicates share the same level of precedence (as in Python) to
   facilitate chaining.")
