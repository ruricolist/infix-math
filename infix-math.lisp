  "Compile an infix math expression, recursively.

One notable feature: handles expressions like (exp 2 - 1), so
it (almost) never needs more parentheses that would be required in an
infix language. (The exception is a leading unary negation: that still
requires parentheses.)

Another notable feature: you can negate a variable by writing it with a leading dash:

     ($ -x) => (- x)

You can also write a variable with a literal coefficient:

     ($ 2x) => (* 2 x)

Note that literal coefficients have higher priority than binary operations:
